    "readme": "# Nuxt Telemetry Module\n\nNuxt collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage. This helps us to accurately gauge Nuxt feature usage and customization across all our users.\n\nThis program is optional. You will be asked on first time to get permission and you can always [opt-out](#opting-out) if you'd not like to share any information.\n\n## Why collecting Telemetry?\n\nNuxt has grown a lot from its [initial release](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (7 Nov 2016) and we are keep listening to [community feedback](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues) to improve it.\n\nHowever, this manual process only collects feedback from a subset of users that takes the time to fill the issue template and it may have different needs or use-case than you.\n\nNuxt Telemetry collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage. This helps us to accurately gauge feature usage and customization across all our users. This data will let us better understand how Nuxt is used globally, measuring improvements made (DX and performances) and their relevance.\n\n## Events\n\nWe collect multiple events:\n\n- Command invoked (`nuxt dev`, `nuxt build`, etc)\n- Versions of Nuxt and Node.js\n- General machine informations (MacOS/Linux/Windows and if command is run within CI, ci name)\n- Duration of the Webpack build and average size of the application, as well as the generation stats (when using `nuxt generate` or `nuxt export`)\n- What are the *public dependency* of your project (Nuxt modules)\n\nYou can see the list of events in [lib/events](./src/events).\n\nExample of an event:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"name\": \"NUXT_PROJECT\",\n   \"payload\": {\n    \"type\": \"GIT\",\n    \"isSSR\": true,\n    \"target\": \"server\",\n    \"isTypescriptBuild\": false,\n    \"isTypescriptRuntime\": false,\n    \"isProgrammatic\": false,\n    \"packageManager\": \"npm\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nTo display the exact data that will be sent, you can use `NUXT_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1`.\n\n## Sensitive data\n\nWe take your privacy and our security very seriously.\n\nWe do not collect any metrics which may contain sensitive data.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to: environment variables, file paths, contents of files, logs, or serialized JavaScript errors.\n\nThe data we collect is completely anonymous, not traceable to the source (using hash+seed), and only meaningful in aggregate form. No data we collect is personally identifiable or trackable.\n\n## Opting-out\n\nYou can disable Nuxt Telemetry for your project with several ways:\n\n1. Setting `telemetry: false` in your `nuxt.config`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  telemetry: false\n}\n```\n\n2. Using an environment variable:\n\n```bash\nNUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1\n```\n\n3. Using `npx nuxt telemetry disable`\n\n```bash\nnpx nuxt telemetry [status|enable|disable] [-g,--global] [dir]\n```\n\n## Skip Prompt\n\nIf you encounter problems with consent prompt, and want to participate without asking this question, you can set `telemetry: true` from `nuxt.config`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  telemetry: true\n}\n```\n\n## Thank you\n\nWe want to thank you for participating in this telemetry program to help us better understand how you use Nuxt to keep improving it ðŸ’š\n\n## Development\n\n- Run `yarn dev:prepare` to generate type stubs.\n- Use `yarn dev` to start [playground](./playground) in development mode.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](./LICENSE)\n",
